Module-1

Cloud computing is delivery of computing services over the intenet,enabling faster innovation ,flexible resources and ec
economies of scale.
Cloud computing is enabling ubiqtous, convienient and on-demand network acess to a shared
pool of configurable computer-resources (network,storage,etc) to manage and release it without any external 
cloud provider.

Public cloud
-owned by cloud services
-provides resources to multiple organisations/users
-accessed via secure network connection

Private
-organisations create a cloud environment
-organisation is responsible for operating services
-external users cannot use it

Hybrid cloud
public+private to allow applications to run in most appropriate locations

Cloud benefits and considerations
High availibilty       Fault tolerance
scalability            Elasticity
global reach           Customer latency capabilities
agilty                 Predictive cost considerations
disaster recovery      Security

Vertical scaling-scaling up
Horizontal scaling-scaling down

Capex vs Opex
Capital- Expenditure                    Operational Expenditure
-physical infrastructure cost           spend pn products and servuces as needed
-reduces over time                      get billed immediately

Cloud Services
-Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
building pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers,
virtual machines,storage,etc from a cloud provider.
-Platform as a Service(PaaS)
provides environment for bulding,testing, and deploying software
applications,managed by the cloud provider.
-Software as a servicr(SaaS)
users connect and use cloud-based apps over the internet

Shared responsibilty model
-on premises(private cloud)
